# This script runs all benchmarks, writing each benchark's results
# to a separate file in the benchmarks/ directory.
# For the BenchmarkFoo function, the file would be named Foo.tmp
# This is intentional to avoid overwriting the baseline Foo.txt file,
# which is checked into version control.
#
# This script is normally only used when establishing a baseline or
# bencharking on a new system/os/....
# The same effect can be achieved for a single benchmark like this:
#
#   $ ./bench.sh "BenchmarkFoo$" 20 > benchmarks/Foo.tmp

# This is what works on my mac, using homebrew versions of grep and sed.
# The BSD versions supplied with mac os don't work the same way.
